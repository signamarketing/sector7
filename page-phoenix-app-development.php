You may need an Admin Dashboard for Business to Business apps, an app landing page for promotional purposes, or any other kind of web app to compliment your business venture. In many cases the web application can also be used to provide the same functionality as the mobile app, but for browser-based applications as some users may prefer to use a browser-accessed app.</p>
